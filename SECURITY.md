## Security Policy

### Reporting
- Please report vulnerabilities privately via email: security@omniversal-media.com.
- Avoid filing public issues for suspected vulnerabilities.

### Supported branches
- `main` is the only supported branch for security fixes.

### Secrets
- Never commit real credentials or API keys. Use the example env file (`everlightos-aether/bootstrap/aether.env.example`) and keep real values in ignored locations (`secrets/`).

### Expectations
- We aim to acknowledge reports within 2 business days and provide a remediation plan or fix ETA within 7 business days.
